# Proton dualsense

update:

[ClearlyClaire/wine - proton-wine-9.0-1+dualsense](https://github.com/ClearlyClaire/wine/commits/proton-wine-9.0-1%2Bdualsense/) patches are already merged so they are no longer necessary: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5900#issuecomment-3447208162

The only patch being applied is a new one from [xzn](https://github.com/xzn) https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5900#issuecomment-3588361963 (thank you!), it’s specifically tested with Stellar Blade and makes the rumble work.
